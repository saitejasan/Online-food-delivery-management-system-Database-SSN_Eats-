However, the table contains transitive dependencies, such as restaurantid → itemid and restaurantid → ownerid, which violate the Third Normal Form (3NF). To make the table comply with BCNF, we need to break it down into separate tables that eliminate these transitive dependencies.

restaurantid, itemid → (composite primary key)
